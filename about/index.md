# About me

My birth name is Le Viet Bach (Bach is the given name).

I am passionate about technology and game development.
From the age of 14, I have made it my goal to become a professional game programmer.

I am completing my final year for a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Media at the NUS School of Computing (SoC).
