# Introduction

Color grid is a fast paced match-3 game for mobile devices.
It's currently available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubycell.colorgridpro).

I was involved in the project during my time in [Rubycell Entertainment] [1] (2011).

# My role and contributions

I was the gameplay programmer for the project.
My contributions include:

- The basic match-3 system
- Ensuring that players can shoot new blocks even during the board's animation
- Interface for powerups items
- Some bonus items

# Technologies and tools used

- Corona engine: http://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/
