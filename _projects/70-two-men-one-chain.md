# Introduction

"Two men one chain" is a cooperative endless run game developed for NM4209 (Advanced Game Design) in 2014.

In this game, two characters are tied to each other using a chain.
They have to cooperate to avoid obstacles and defeat an enemy boss who is constantly throwing attack at them.
The game can be played by two players or one player with an AI partner.

The game generates its level randomly by stiching together manually-designed "chunks".

# My role and contributions

As the main programmer in a team of 5, I was responsible for most of the gameplay programming.
My contributions include:

- Behaviour of the AI partner
- Implementing game rules
- Implementing the level generation system
- Implementing an in-game editor for the level designer to create and test level "chunks".
