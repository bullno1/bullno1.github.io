# Introduction

Galaxy Editor is the in-house level editor for [Galaxy Cannon] [1].
I was involved in the project during my time in [Rubycell Entertainment] [2] (2011).

It features a fully WYSIWYG environment with the following features:

- Play test a level right in the editor
- Run on a tablet like iPad to preserve the feel of touch control
- Adjust an object's collision mask
- Move, delete and copy an entire group of objects
- Backup levels to the company's server

# My role and contributions

I was largely responsible for most of the features in the editor including:

- GUI and interaction
- Serialization/deserialization system
- Network backup

# Technologies and tools used

- Corona engine: http://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/
- [Lua] [3]
