# Introduction

Galaxy Cannon is a physic-based puzzle game.
I was involved in the project during my time in [Rubycell Entertainment] [1] (2011).

The aim of the game is to destroy all red spheres on the screen with a touch-controlled cannon.

The game has a custom [level editor] [2] for internal use.

# My role and contributions

- Programmed most game objects such as: Black hole, springboard, portal...
- Created the [level editor] [2]
- Created basic GUI classes
- Created the 3D rotating main menu

# Technologies and tools used

- Corona engine: http://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/
- [Lua] [3]
